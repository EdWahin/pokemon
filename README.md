# Pokemon Web App

This project was made by using React, Scss. You can use this link [Pokemon](https://edwahin.github.io/pokemon) to open it on GitHub Pages. I truly enjoyed while doing it. There is different kind of fetching data: either inside Component or separate Component. I have done adaptive styling, added loading on getting one Pokemon by clicking from the list of characters. And made disabled `Load More` button when user click to update Pokemons.
